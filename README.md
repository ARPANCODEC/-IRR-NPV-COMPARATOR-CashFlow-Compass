# 💹 CashFlow Compass

**CashFlow Compass** is a Streamlit-based financial analysis tool that helps evaluate projects using **IRR (Internal Rate of Return)** and **NPV (Net Present Value)**.  
It also displays **detailed calculation steps** such as:

- **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) table**: Year, Cash Flow, Discount Factor, Present Value, and Cumulative PV.  
- **Newton’s Method iteration log** for IRR: iteration, guess, NPV, derivative, next guess, and error.  

This makes financial decision-making transparent and easy to understand.
